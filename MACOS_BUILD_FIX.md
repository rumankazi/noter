# macOS-Only Build & Release Setup ‚úÖ

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Multi-Platform Complexity Removed**
- **Before**: Workflow tried to build for Windows, macOS, and Linux simultaneously
- **After**: Simplified to macOS-only builds for initial testing
- **Benefit**: Easier to debug and isolate issues

### 2. **Branch Configuration Fixed**
- **Before**: Workflow triggered on `test-release` but checked for `main` branch
- **After**: Updated to support both `main` and `test-release` branches
- **Fix**: 
  ```yaml
  on:
    push:
      branches: [main, test-release]
  
  build:
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && (github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' || github.ref == 'refs/heads/test-release')
  ```

### 3. **Semantic-Release Assets Simplified**
- **Before**: Configured for Windows, macOS, and Linux assets
- **After**: Only macOS assets (`.dmg` and `.zip`)
- **Configuration**:
  ```json
  "assets": [
    {
      "path": "release/*.dmg",
      "label": "macOS Installer (${nextRelease.gitTag})"
    },
    {
      "path": "release/*.zip", 
      "label": "macOS Archive (${nextRelease.gitTag})"
    }
  ]
  ```

### 4. **Enhanced Debugging Added**
- Added Git configuration debugging step
- Enhanced semantic-release with `--debug` flag
- Better error tracking for permission issues

## Current Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: Build and Release

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    # Runs tests and lint
    
  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: macos-latest
    # Builds and packages macOS app
    # Uploads artifacts
    
  release:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Downloads artifacts
    # Runs semantic-release
```

## Expected Outputs

### **Build Artifacts**
- `Noter-X.X.X-mac-arm64.dmg` - macOS ARM installer
- `Noter-X.X.X-mac-arm64.zip` - macOS ARM archive
- `Noter-X.X.X-mac-x64.dmg` - macOS Intel installer  
- `Noter-X.X.X-mac-x64.zip` - macOS Intel archive

### **Release Process**
1. **Tests** ‚úÖ - All 75 tests passing
2. **Build** ‚úÖ - Application builds successfully
3. **Package** ‚è≥ - Creates macOS installers
4. **Release** ‚è≥ - Creates GitHub release with assets

## Code Signing Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **Expected Warning**: 
```
skipped macOS application code signing
reason=cannot find valid "Developer ID Application" identity
```

This is **normal** for CI builds. The app will work but show security warnings until we add proper code signing certificates.

## What's Next

### **Immediate** (Testing Phase)
1. Monitor current workflow execution
2. Verify macOS builds are created
3. Test installation on macOS devices
4. Confirm semantic-release works

### **Future** (Production Ready)
1. Add code signing certificates for trusted installations
2. Expand to Windows and Linux once macOS is stable
3. Add Mac App Store distribution
4. Implement auto-updater

## Testing the Release

Once the workflow completes:

1. **Check GitHub Actions**: Verify all jobs pass
2. **Download Artifacts**: Test the generated `.dmg` and `.zip` files
3. **Install & Test**: Install on macOS and verify functionality
4. **Monitor Releases**: Check if semantic-release creates proper GitHub releases

**Status**: Workflow simplified and ready for macOS-only testing üöÄ
