# Noter - Cross-Platform Note Taking App

## Project Overview

Noter is a lightweight, fast, cross-platform note-taking app that works offline without requiring installation. Initially targeting Windows, macOS, and Linux with future mobile platform support.

## Core Features

- **Offline-first**: Works completely offline with local database storage
- **Folder Management**: Create folders, drag notes between folders
- **General Folder**: Persistent default folder for notes created without specific folder
- **Auto-save**: Automatic saving on focus change
- **Live Preview**: Side panel for markdown preview
- **Markdown Support**: Full markdown formatting with linting
- **Search**: Search functionality across all notes
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete notes and folders

## Development Philosophy

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests first, code second
- **Self-Documenting Code**: All documentation through code itself
- **Minimal Documentation**:
  - Architecture document (keep updated)
  - Single README for developers and users
  - Progress tracking document
- **Best Practices**: Follow SOLID principles, clean architecture for future extensibility

## Technical Requirements

- Cross-platform desktop app (Electron/Tauri recommended)
- Offline database (SQLite/IndexedDB)
- No installation required (portable executable)
- Lightweight and fast performance
- pnpm as package manager for fast, efficient dependency management

## Development Workflow

- **Git Hooks**: Husky with commitlint
- **Testing**: E2E tests for all platforms
- **CI/CD**: Automatic deployment on main branch merge/workflow dispatch
- **Releases**: Semantic-release automation

## Development Strategy

1. Start with "Hello World" app to verify cross-platform compatibility
2. Implement core architecture with tests
3. Add features incrementally following TDD
4. Maintain documentation and progress tracking

## Technology Stack (To Be Determined)

- Frontend: Web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Desktop Framework: Electron or Tauri
- Database: SQLite or IndexedDB
- Package Manager: pnpm
- Testing: Jest, Playwright for E2E
- Build: Vite/Webpack
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
