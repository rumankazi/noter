2. Release patch version immediately
3. Update release notes

### Option 2: Revert Release
1. Mark release as "Pre-release" in GitHub
2. Delete installers from release
3. Pin previous version in README
4. Post notice about issue

### Option 3: Deprecate Version

- **1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0**: New features, backwards compatible
- **1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0**: Breaking changes

### Pre-Release Versions
- **1.0.0-beta.1**: Beta test version
- **1.0.0-rc.1**: Release candidate

---

## Automated Checks

Before creating release, GitHub Actions will:
- [ ] Run all tests

- [ ] Package installers
- [ ] Calculate checksums
- [ ] Upload artifacts

If any step fails, fix issues before proceeding.

---

## Security

### Code Signing (Future)
- [ ] Sign Windows executables
- [ ] Sign macOS apps
- [ ] Notarize macOS apps

### Checksums
- [ ] Generate SHA256 for each artifact
- [ ] Include in release notes
- [ ] Document verification process

---

## Metrics to Track

After release, monitor:
- Download count per platform
- Crash reports (if telemetry added)
- GitHub issues created
- User feedback
- Performance metrics
