# Distribution & Packaging - Complete Setup

## ‚úÖ What's Been Configured

### 1. **Package.json Enhancements**
- Made package public for distribution
- Added platform-specific package scripts:
  - `pnpm package:win` - Windows installer
  - `pnpm package:mac` - macOS DMG
  - `pnpm package:linux` - Linux packages
  - `pnpm package:all` - All platforms
- Enhanced electron-builder configuration:
  - **Windows**: NSIS installer + Portable exe
  - **macOS**: DMG + ZIP for Intel and Apple Silicon
  - **Linux**: AppImage + DEB + RPM

### 2. **GitHub Actions Workflows**

#### Production Build (`.github/workflows/build.yml`)
**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch
- Git tags starting with `v*`
- Manual workflow dispatch

**What it does:**
- Builds on Windows, macOS, and Linux runners
- Runs all tests
- Creates installers for each platform
- Uploads artifacts (30-day retention)
- **On Git tag**: Creates GitHub Release automatically

#### Development Build (`.github/workflows/dev-build.yml`)
**Triggers:**
- Push to `develop` or `feature/*` branches
- Manual workflow dispatch

**What it does:**
- Quick builds for testing
- Unpacked apps (no installers)
- Artifacts retained for 7 days

### 3. **Documentation Created**

- **[INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md)** - Complete user installation guide
  - Download instructions for all platforms
  - Installation steps (Windows/macOS/Linux)
  - System requirements
  - Troubleshooting
  - Silent installation for enterprise

- **[DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)** - Complete developer guide
  - Development setup
  - Building from source
  - Testing and debugging
  - Contributing guidelines
  - CI/CD documentation

- **[RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md](RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md)** - Release process
  - Pre-release checks
  - Version management
  - Build and test procedures
  - Post-release monitoring

- **Updated user docs** (HOW_TO_USE.md, README.md)
  - Now points to installation guide
  - Clear separation: users vs developers

### 4. **Build Directory**
- Created `build/` folder for app icons
- Added README.md with icon requirements
- Ready for icon files when designed
