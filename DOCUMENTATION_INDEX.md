## The Core Concept

**Noter is designed to be so simple that documentation shouldn't be necessary.**

If users need to read docs to understand basic features, we've failed.

### The 3-Second Pitch
"Click `+`, type, it saves automatically."

### The Design Philosophy
1. **One-click creation** - No forms, no settings, just create
2. **Auto-save** - Never think about saving
3. **Optional organization** - Folders only if you want them
4. **Local-first** - Your data, your computer, no cloud
5. **No cruft** - Only features that 80% of users need

---

## Documentation Principles

### For Users
- **Start simple, add detail progressively**
- Use plain English, no jargon
- Show, don't tell (use examples)
- Answer "why" not just "how"
- Make skimming easy (headers, bullets, diagrams)

### For Developers
- Code should be self-documenting
- Comments explain "why", not "what"
- Architecture docs separate from usage
- Keep it up-to-date or delete it

---

## What's Missing?

### Planned Documentation
- [ ] Video tutorial (1 min)
- [ ] GIF demos for key features
- [ ] FAQ page
- [ ] Migration guide (from other apps)
- [ ] Backup/restore guide
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts poster

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Plugin development guide (future)
- [ ] Theming guide (future)
- [ ] API documentation (if we add one)
- [ ] Mobile app guide (if we build one)

## Feedback Loop

**Users confused?** â†’ Update docs â†’ Test with new users â†’ Repeat

**Goal:** Every new user should understand Noter in under 60 seconds.

---

## File Sizes

Keep documentation scannable:
- HOW_TO_USE.md: ~100 lines (30 sec read)
- QUICK_START.md: ~200 lines (2 min read)
- VISUAL_GUIDE.md: ~300 lines (5 min read)
- USER_GUIDE.md: ~500 lines (10 min read)
- README.md: ~300 lines (technical reference)

**Rule:** If a doc is longer than 500 lines, split it.

---

## Help Improve Docs

**Found something confusing?**
1. Open an issue: "Docs: [what's confusing]"
2. Suggest a fix
3. We'll update it

**Want to contribute?**
1. Fork repo
2. Edit docs
3. Submit PR with:
   - What you changed
   - Why (which part was confusing)
   - Who benefits (new users? developers?)

---

## The Bottom Line

**Noter should be so simple that users never need documentation.**

But when they do, it should:
1. Answer their question in 30 seconds
2. Not require reading a novel
3. Use plain English and examples
4. Make them feel smart, not stupid

**Documentation is a UI problem.** If docs are needed, maybe the UI should change instead.
