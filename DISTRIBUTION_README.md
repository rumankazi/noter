## Creating Your First Release

### Automatic with Semantic Release (Recommended)

Just push conventional commits to main:

```bash
# Make changes
git add .

# Commit with conventional format
git commit -m "feat: add dark mode support"

# Push to main
git push origin main

# GitHub Actions automatically:
# - Builds for all platforms
# - Determines version from commits
# - Updates package.json and CHANGELOG.md
# - Creates release with installers
```

See [SEMANTIC_RELEASE.md](SEMANTIC_RELEASE.md) for complete guide.

### Manual (Alternative)

#### 1. Test Locally
```bash
# Build and test on your platform
pnpm build
pnpm package

# Test the installer
# Windows: release/Noter-1.0.0-win-x64.exe
# macOS: release/Noter-1.0.0-mac-x64.dmg
# Linux: release/Noter-1.0.0-linux-x64.AppImage
```

#### 2. Create Release

**Option A: Semantic Release (Automatic)**
```bash
# Use conventional commits and push
git commit -m "feat: add amazing feature"
git push origin main
# Automatically creates release!
```

**Option B: Manual Tag**
```bash
# Make sure everything is committed
git add .
git commit -m "chore: prepare v1.0.0"
git push origin main

# Create and push the version tag
npm version 1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

#### 3. Wait for Builds
GitHub Actions will automatically:
- Build for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Run all tests
- Create installers
- Create a GitHub Release
- Upload all installers

Check progress at: https://github.com/rumankazi/noter/actions

### 4. Publish Release
1. Go to https://github.com/rumankazi/noter/releases
2. Find the draft release
3. Edit release notes (auto-generated)

1. **Create App Icons**
   - See `build/README.md` for requirements

   - Add LICENSE file
   - Add CONTRIBUTING.md

3. **Test on Multiple Platforms**
   - Build locally on Windows/macOS/Linux
