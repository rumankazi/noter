# Folder Rename and Delete Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added comprehensive folder management capabilities including rename and delete operations with a context menu UI.

## Changes Made

### 1. Store Updates (`src/renderer/src/stores/appStore.ts`)

#### New Methods Added:
- **`renameFolder(folderId: string)`**: Shows a prompt dialog to rename a folder
  - Pre-fills the current folder name in the input
  - Updates the folder via the Electron API
  - Updates the local store with the renamed folder

- **`deleteFolder(folderId: string)`**: Safely deletes a folder with confirmation
  - Checks if the folder contains subfolders or notes
  - Shows appropriate confirmation message based on contents
  - Deletes the folder and its contents via the Electron API
  - Updates the local store by removing the folder

### 2. UI Updates (`src/renderer/src/components/FolderTree.tsx`)

#### New Imports:
- `Edit2`, `Trash2`, `MoreVertical` icons from lucide-react

#### FolderItem Component Enhancements:
- **Context Menu Button**: Added a three-dot menu button that appears on hover
- **Dropdown Menu**: Shows "Rename" and "Delete" options
- **Event Handlers**:
  - `handleMenuToggle`: Toggles the context menu visibility
  - `handleRename`: Triggers the rename dialog
  - `handleDelete`: Triggers the delete confirmation
- **Click Outside Detection**: Auto-closes menu when clicking outside

#### Visual Features:
- Menu button only visible on folder hover (using Tailwind's `group-hover` utility)
- Context menu positioned absolutely below the menu button
- Delete option styled in red to indicate destructive action
- Proper z-index to ensure menu appears above other elements

### 3. Test Coverage (`src/tests/FolderActions.test.tsx`)

Added comprehensive test suite with 3 test cases:
1. **Rename Test**: Verifies folder can be renamed
2. **Delete Test**: Verifies folder can be deleted and removed from store
3. **Delete with Contents Test**: Verifies confirmation dialog appears when deleting folders with contents

## User Experience

### Renaming a Folder:
1. Hover over a folder in the sidebar
2. Click the three-dot menu button (⋮)
3. Click "Rename"
4. Enter new name in the prompt dialog (current name pre-filled)
5. Click "Confirm" or press Enter

### Deleting a Folder:
1. Hover over a folder in the sidebar
2. Click the three-dot menu button (⋮)
3. Click "Delete" (shown in red)
4. Confirm deletion in the dialog
   - If folder is empty: Simple confirmation
   - If folder has contents: Warning about deleting all contents
5. Click "Confirm" to delete

## Safety Features

1. **Confirmation Dialog**: Always shown before deletion
2. **Content Warning**: Explicitly warns when deleting folders with subfolders or notes
3. **General Folder Protection**: The special "General" folder (for notes without a folder) cannot be renamed or deleted as it's rendered separately and doesn't show the context menu
4. **Store Cleanup**: When a folder is deleted, associated notes are automatically filtered out via the `removeFolder` action

## Backend Support

The feature leverages existing backend functionality:
- `window.electronAPI.folders.update()` - Already implemented in FolderService
- `window.electronAPI.folders.delete()` - Already implemented in FolderService
- Both methods properly save to the database and maintain data integrity

## Test Results

- ✅ All 74 tests passing (71 existing + 3 new)
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ App runs correctly in development mode
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add F2 for rename, Delete for delete when folder is selected
2. **Drag to Rename**: Double-click folder name to rename inline
3. **Undo/Redo**: Add ability to undo folder deletion
4. **Trash/Archive**: Move deleted folders to trash instead of permanent deletion
5. **Folder Colors**: Allow users to assign colors to folders
6. **Folder Icons**: Allow users to choose custom icons for folders
