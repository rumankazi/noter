- **Build**: Vite + electron-builder
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions + semantic-release

### Architecture Decisions
- Clean Architecture with layered approach
- Dependency injection for testability
- IPC for main-renderer communication
- Context API for React state management

### Future Considerations
- Plugin system architecture for extensibility
- Mobile app development (React Native/Flutter)
- Cloud sync as optional feature
- Collaborative editing capabilities
